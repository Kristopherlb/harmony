# Checkpoint: Mandatory Retros Protocol

**Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Session:** Todo `mandatory-retros`  
**Time Spent:** ~15 minutes

## Progress

### Completed
- [x] Created per-todo checkpoints for assigned work.
- [x] Prepared final session retrospective structure and required sections.
- [x] Identified tracker updates for PATTERNS/IMPROVEMENTS.

### In Progress
- [ ] Final session retrospective publishing.

### Remaining
- [ ] Complete final follow-up checks.

## Key Learnings

1. Frequent checkpoints reduce context loss in multi-todo sessions.
2. Reflection-to-action prompts force immediate process hardening.

## Friction Points

| Issue | Impact | Potential Solution |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Retros can be deferred when coding momentum is high | Loss of actionable learnings | Make checkpoint creation explicit per todo |

## Improvement Opportunities

- [ ] **Workflow:** Add helper command to scaffold per-todo checkpoint files.

## Plan Alignment (Mandatory)

- Plan drift observed: none
- Proposed plan update(s): checklist line item should require checkpoint file path per todo.
- Any new required preflight steps: none

## Improvements / Capabilities That Would Help Next

- [ ] **Tooling:** generator for retrospective checkpoint stubs by todo IDs.

## Questions / Blockers

1. None
2. None

## Reflection-to-Action (Mandatory)

1. Is there anything you know now that if you knew when you started you would do differently?  
   Yes, scaffold checkpoint files at session start.
2. Any decisions you would change?  
   No.
3. Any of that actionable that you would do now given the opportunity?  
   Yes, keep tracker updates in same session as final retro.
