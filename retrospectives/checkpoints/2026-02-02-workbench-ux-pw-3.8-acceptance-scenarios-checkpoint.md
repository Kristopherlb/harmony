## Progress

### Completed
- [x] Pre-work 3.8: Deterministic Acceptance Scenario Pack
  - Created `product-management/workbench-ux.acceptance.json`: scenario fixtures for 7 acceptance criteria from workbench-ux.md §5 (Conversational Workflow Building, Chat-to-Canvas Edit Loop, No Context Loss, Generative Blueprint Revision, Library Usage Ease, Execution & Orchestration, Onboarding & Learnability)
  - Each scenario includes: given/when/then, success measure, fixtures (inputs, expected IR diffs/draft, expected UI assertions)

### Plan Alignment
- Enables Phase 4.x testing tasks (unit/E2E) and regression protection.
