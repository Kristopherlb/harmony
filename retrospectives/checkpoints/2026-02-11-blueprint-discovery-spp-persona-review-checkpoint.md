# Checkpoint: SPP Persona Review

**Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Session:** Todo `spp-persona-review`  
**Time Spent:** ~15 minutes

## Progress

### Completed
- [x] Produced five-persona readiness scoring.
- [x] Recorded gap mitigations with validation-level labels.
- [x] Confirmed threshold: average >= 7.0 and no unresolved P0.

### In Progress
- [ ] Keep scores calibrated against implementation outcomes.

### Remaining
- [ ] Final retrospective close-out and tracker updates.

## Key Learnings

1. Persona scoring is most useful when tied directly to concrete artifacts.
2. Validation-level labeling prevents “contract complete” from being mistaken for runtime complete.

## Friction Points

| Issue | Impact | Potential Solution |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Persona reviews can become abstract if not evidence-linked | Lower execution value | Attach every gap to file/test evidence |

## Improvement Opportunities

- [ ] **Workflow:** Add SPP scoring table template to Workbench docs folder.

## Plan Alignment (Mandatory)

- Plan drift observed: none
- Proposed plan update(s): require evidence column for each persona mitigation.
- Any new required preflight steps: none

## Improvements / Capabilities That Would Help Next

- [ ] **Tooling:** Lightweight script to validate persona score thresholds in plan docs.

## Questions / Blockers

1. None
2. None

## Reflection-to-Action (Mandatory)

1. Is there anything you know now that if you knew when you started you would do differently?  
   Yes, score personas only after confirming exact implementation boundaries.
2. Any decisions you would change?  
   No.
3. Any of that actionable that you would do now given the opportunity?  
   Yes, include validation-level labels directly in the persona output.
