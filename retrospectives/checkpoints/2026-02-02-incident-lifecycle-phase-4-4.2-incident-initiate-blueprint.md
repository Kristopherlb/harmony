## Progress
- [x] Todo completed: Phase 4.2 `incident.initiate` blueprint
- [x] Implemented deterministic logic with unit tests:
  - `packages/blueprints/src/workflows/incident/incident-initiate.logic.ts`
  - `packages/blueprints/src/workflows/incident/incident-initiate.logic.test.ts`
- [x] Implemented workflow + run entry + contract tests:
  - `packages/blueprints/src/workflows/incident/incident-initiate.workflow.ts`
  - `packages/blueprints/src/workflows/incident/incident-initiate.workflow-run.ts`
  - `packages/blueprints/src/workflows/incident/incident-initiate.workflow.test.ts`
- [x] Added blueprint descriptor:
  - `packages/blueprints/src/descriptors/incident-initiate.descriptor.ts`

## Learnings
- A “logic module + workflow wrapper” structure makes it straightforward to unit test capability orchestration without Temporal test harness complexity.
- The suite benefits from explicit, typed capability inputs (especially operation enums) instead of trying to push constants through generator-style `input_mapping`.

## Friction
- Blueprint registries/workflow export indices are generated by `@golden/path:sync`; until sync is run, new workflows/descriptors won’t be discoverable via registry/MCP.

## Opportunities
- Add an e2e Temporal test harness for incident workflows (similar to the generated e2e scripts) once the suite stabilizes.
- Introduce a small “incident timeline event” capability to centralize audit trail entries (currently a documented gap).

## Plan Alignment
- Plan drift: none (blueprint created as requested).
- Proposed plan updates:
  - Explicitly run `pnpm nx g @golden/path:sync` after adding each blueprint so registry/discovery stays current during development.

## Improvements / Capabilities That Would Help Next
- A reusable helper for composing Slack message text/blocks for incident updates (shared across initiate/remediate/close-out/post-mortem).
