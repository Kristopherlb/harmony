## Progress

### Completed
- [x] Pre-work 3.6: Chat→IR Contract
  - Created `spec/workbench-ir.schema.json`: BlueprintDraft + BlueprintNode/Edge, EditIntent union (add, remove, rename, reorder, connect, branch, configure)
  - Created `docs/workbench-ir-validation.md`: validation rules and user-facing error surfacing guidance

### Plan Alignment
- Enables Pre-work 3.7 (state model ADR) and Phase 4.2 (generative iteration).
