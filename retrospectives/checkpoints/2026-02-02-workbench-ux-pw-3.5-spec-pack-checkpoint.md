**Date:** 2026-02-02  
**Session:** Pre-work 3.5 – Workbench UX Spec Pack

---

## Progress

### Completed
- [x] Pre-work 3.5: Workbench UX Spec Pack
  - Created `product-management/workbench-ux.spec.md` with:
    - Glossary (workflow, blueprint, draft, template, step/node, IR)
    - Approval/confirmation policy (Propose / Apply / Require approval; RESTRICTED → require approval)
    - UX modes (Build vs Run) and persistence rules

### Plan Alignment
- No drift; spec enables Pre-work 3.6 (Chat→IR contract) and 3.9 (analytics taxonomy).
