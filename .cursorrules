# Agent Behavior Rules

1. **Session Startup**: You MUST read `.cursor/skills/AGENT_STARTUP.md` at the start of every session.
2. **Pattern Awareness**: You MUST check `/retrospectives/PATTERNS.md` for known friction points before starting work.
3. **Skill Discovery**: You MUST check `.cursor/skills/` (project) and `~/.cursor/skills/` (global) for relevant skills before planning.
4. **Architecture Compliance**: Adhere to the patterns defined in `workflow-composition-standard` and `agent-specification-standard` located in `.cursor/skills`.

# Context
This project uses the Cortex/Harmony architecture. All workflows must be deterministic and follow the `BaseBlueprint` pattern.
