# Foundation Over Workarounds

- Implement root-cause fixes at the correct architectural boundary first (domain/module invariant before route/UI patching).
- Avoid one-off conditionals, special cases, or duplicated validation logic unless a shared abstraction is not yet possible.
- If a quick patch is used temporarily, include a clear `TODO:` with owner/context and a near-term replacement plan in the same change.
- Prefer shared modules, typed contracts, and deterministic tests that prevent regression rather than relying on manual discipline.
- Optimize for long-term readability and maintenance cost, even when it requires extra upfront effort.

Definition of done for behavioral changes:

1. Failing test proves the bug/requirement.
2. Minimal implementation passes.
3. Refactor to the most durable boundary.
4. Verify no duplicated workaround remains in adapters/routes/UI.
