# UI/UX Pro Max

Use this skill when building or modifying UI components, flows, or operator experiences.

## Operator Console Heuristics

- **Default to clarity**: show the “why” and “what happens next”.
- **Progressive disclosure**: hide advanced details until needed.
- **Strong empty states**: explain what’s missing and how to fix it.
- **Fast feedback**: loading, success, error, and retry paths must be visible.

## Accessibility & Usability

- Keyboard navigation works (tab order, focus states).
- Buttons/links have clear labels and do not rely on color alone.
- Error messages are actionable and do not blame the user.

## toggle / settings patterns

- Prefer explicit “On/Off” states over ambiguous labels.
- Preserve user intent during retries; avoid wiping inputs.
