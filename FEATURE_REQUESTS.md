### Self-Auditing Pipeline Builder Skill

**Request:** Create a skill that implements Phase 5 Self-Auditing Pipeline tasks (contract runner, schema drift detection, OSCAL synthesis, CI wiring, certification registry) to close the recurring gap between standards and enforcement tooling.

**Rationale:** Phase 5 requirements (TCS-001 / CAS-001) repeatedly define compliance gates without bundled tooling guidance. A dedicated skill would standardize the implementation path and reduce drift between documentation and CI enforcement.
