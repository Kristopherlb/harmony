  "title": "Sample Plan: Incident On-Call Handoff Improvements",
  "owner": "platform-devex",
  "domain": "incident-management",
  "status": "draft",
  "intent": "Improve on-call handoff quality by standardizing incident context capture, ensuring the NOC header shows current incident state, and providing a short checklist for responders.",
  "goals": [
    "Add a durable incident context model that can be referenced across workflows.",
    "Ensure the console UI can render a consistent incident banner header.",
    "Provide a small set of runbooks that operators can follow during handoff."
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "No external secrets or credentials in this plan or fixtures.",
    "Keep changes deterministic for Temporal workflows (no non-deterministic APIs in workflow bundles).",
    "Prefer generators/utilities where possible instead of ad-hoc scripts."
  ],
  "nonGoals": [
    "Building a full incident management product.",
    "Adding new integrations beyond what already exists."
  ],
  "deliverables": [
    "A capability/skill documenting the incident context and signal/query patterns.",
    "A minimal UI surface that renders the current incident context.",
    "Tests for core context parsing and rendering logic.",
    "A checkpoint-style retrospective entry capturing learnings and friction."
  ],
  "phases": [
    {
      "id": "phase-0",
      "title": "Pre-work",
      "tasks": [
        "Document missing patterns as a skill (reasoner, prompt structure, determinism boundaries).",
        "Create minimal fixtures for plan parsing (file/content/intent).",
        "Capture a pre-work checkpoint."
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "phase-1",
      "title": "Implementation",
      "tasks": [
        "Implement incident context types and serialization rules.",
        "Add UI banner/header rendering using the context model.",
        "Add small runbooks for the operator journey."
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "phase-2",
      "title": "Verification",
      "tasks": [
        "Unit tests for context model + serialization.",
        "UI tests for banner rendering.",
        "Documentation review."
      ]
    }
  ],
  "successMetrics": [
    "A new responder can understand incident state in < 60 seconds using the banner + runbooks.",
    "Tests cover the primary state transitions and rendering scenarios."
