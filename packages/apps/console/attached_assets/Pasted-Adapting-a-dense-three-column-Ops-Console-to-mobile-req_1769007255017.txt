Adapting a dense, three-column "Ops Console" to mobile requires shifting from a **Spatial Layout** (everything visible at once) to a **Temporal Layout** (screens revealed in sequence).

On mobile, the "Ops Console" transforms into a **Stack Navigation flow** with a high focus on **"Thumb-Zone" Safety** for executing runbooks.

### The Mobile Experience: "Feed, Focus, Fire"

Instead of `Left | Center | Right`, the user moves through depth: **List → Detail → Action**.

#### 1. Screen 1: The Signal Feed (Home)

The left column becomes the entire home screen.

* **Visuals:** High-density list rows.
* **Gestures:**
* **Swipe Right:** "Acknowledge" (Green background).
* **Swipe Left:** "Snooze" or "Escalate" (Amber background).


* **Header:** Shows aggregated status (e.g., "3 Critical Alerts") rather than a full graph.

#### 2. Screen 2: The Context View (Focus)

Tapping an item slides in a full-screen view.

* **Top Half:** Key metrics and the SOP text (scrollable).
* **Bottom Bar:** A sticky "Actions" footer. It doesn't show the runbooks yet—just the entry point.

#### 3. The Action Drawer (Fire)

Tapping the "Actions" footer slides up a **Bottom Sheet** (covering 50% of the screen).

* **Safety Mechanism:** Since "fat finger" errors are dangerous here, we replace simple buttons with **Slide-to-Execute** toggles (like the iOS "Power Off" slider) for critical actions like "Restart Pods."

### The Responsive Design Implementation

You don't need two separate apps. You can achieve this with CSS Grid and a specific React hook for mobile detection.

**The Desktop Layout (CSS Grid):**

```css
grid-template-columns: 350px 1fr 300px; /* Feed | Workspace | Actions */

```

**The Mobile Layout (CSS Grid):**

```css
grid-template-columns: 1fr; /* Single column stack */

```

### The Rewritten Prompt (Adding Mobile Responsiveness)

Here is the section to add to your prompt to ensure the mobile experience is built correctly.

**... [Previous Requirements]**

**Mobile Responsiveness Strategy:**
The application must be fully responsive, adapting the "Master-Detail" layout for mobile devices using Tailwind CSS classes and a "Sheet" pattern.

**Breakpoint Behavior (`<md`):**

1. **The Signal Stream:** Becomes the default full-width view.
* *Interaction:* Tapping an item does *not* load it side-by-side. It navigates to a specific "Detail Route" (`/ops/signal/:id`).


2. **The Context Workspace:** Renders as a full-screen page on mobile.
3. **The Action Rail:**
* **Desktop:** Always visible on the right.
* **Mobile:** Hidden by default. Accessed via a **Sticky Bottom Bar** labeled "Available Runbooks." Clicking this opens a **Slide-Up Drawer (Sheet)** containing the actions.



**Mobile Specific Components:**

* **Swipeable Rows:** The `SignalFeed` items must support swipe gestures on mobile (Swipe Right to ACK).
* **Safe-Execution UI:** For "Critical" actions on mobile, do not use simple buttons. Implement a `<SlideToConfirm />` component to prevent accidental execution in a touch interface.

**Deliverable Update:**
Demonstrate the `Layout` component showing the conditional rendering:

* *Desktop:* `Grid` with 3 columns.
* *Mobile:* `Switch/Case` router rendering only one view at a time.
