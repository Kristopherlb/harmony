Engineering Operations Center (EOC) - Product Requirements1. Executive SummaryThe EOC is an Agentic Internal Developer Portal that consolidates the software engineering lifecycle into a unified "Operating System." It replaces fragmented tools with a Master-Detail Ops Console, enabling a shift from passive observation to active remediation.2. Core Functional ModulesModule A: The Service Graph (Vanilla Catalog)Objective: Establish the System of Record.Data Model: Service-centric graph connecting Code, Infrastructure, Teams, and APIs.Ingestion: Metadata-as-Code via catalog-info.yaml (GitOps).Entities: Services, Resources (AWS/K8s), Teams, Users, Domains.Module B: The Ops Console (UI/UX)Objective: High-velocity context and action.Layout: Three-Pane Console (Signal Stream, Context Workspace, Action Rail).Mobile: "Feed, Focus, Fire" temporal navigation with Slide-to-Confirm safety.Signal Stream: Aggregated feed of Incidents (PagerDuty), Deploys (GitLab), and Logs (Slack).Module C: Service 360 HubObjective: Deep dive visibility per service.Observability: Golden Signals (Latency, Errors, Saturation) via Datadog/Prometheus adapters.Security: Vulnerability Heatmap (Wiz/Xray) normalized to Critical/High/Medium.Delivery: Pipeline status, Artifact links (Artifactory), Version drift.FinOps: Monthly run rate and cost trends.Module D: Action & OrchestrationObjective: Self-service and remediation.Service Catalog: Executable actions backed by Temporal Workflows.Runbooks: Interactive execution of SOPs (e.g., "Flush Cache", "Restart Pods").Guardrails: RBAC checks and Slack-based Approval workflows for Critical actions.Module E: Intelligence (Agentic Layer)Objective: AI-assisted analysis and reporting.Analyst Agent: RAG-based chat interface for querying the "Context Lake".Reporting: Automated generation of Standup, Executive, and Stakeholder reports.Module F: Personal Ops (Self-Management)Objective: Director-level focus and balance.Focus Mode: UI toggle to suppress noise and track "Deep Work" sessions.Career EPO: Widget for tracking long-term professional development goals.Meeting Hygiene: "Time Budget" visualization.3. Technical ArchitectureStack: React, Hono (Bun), Temporal, Zod, Tailwind/shadcn.Pattern: Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) for tool agnosticism.Data: Repository Pattern with Seedable In-Memory store for "Instant Demo" capability.4. Integration StrategyAdapters: Strict TypeScript interfaces for Slack, GitLab, Bitbucket, PagerDuty, Wiz, Jira.Normalization: All external events mapped to internal EventSchema and SecurityFindingSchema.
