# Standards (moved to Cursor skills)

**All normative standards and skill definitions now live under the Cursor Agent Skills layout.**

- **Canonical location:** [`.cursor/skills/`](../.cursor/skills/)
- **Layout:** Each skill is a folder with `SKILL.md` and optional `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`.
- **Full standard text:** See each skill’s `references/` directory for the moved document content.

Mapping and usage are documented in [.cursor/skills/README.md](../.cursor/skills/README.md).
